    <h2>Description</h2>
    <p>A family dinner that delivers four of your 5-a-day - tender chicken, red pepper and black beans, wrapped in tortilla, baked in the oven with passata and cheese</p>
    <h2>Ingredients</h2>
    <ul>
        <li>1 tsp olive oil</li>
        <li>2 onions</li>
        <li>280g carrots</li>
        <li>2-3 tsp chilli powder</li>
        <li>2 tins chopped tomatoes</li>
        <li>2 tins kidney beans</li>
        <li>6 tortillas</li>
        <li>200g natural yoghurt</li>
        <li>50g grated cheese</li>
    </ul>
    <ol>
        <li>Heat the oil in a large frying pan. Cook the onions and carrots for 5-8 mins until soft – add a splash of water if they start to stick. Sprinkle in the chilli powder and cook for 1 min more. Pour in the tomatoes and pulses and bring to the boil. Turn down the heat and simmer for 5-10 mins, stirring occasionally, until thickened. Remove from the heat and season well.</li>
        <li>Heat grill to high. Spread a spoonful of the bean chilli over a large ovenproof dish. Lay each tortilla onto a board, fill with a few tbsp of chilli mixture, fold over the ends and roll up to seal. Place them into the ovenproof dish. Spoon the remaining chilli on top.</li>
        <li>Mix the yogurt and grated cheese together with some seasoning, and spoon over the enchiladas. Grill for a few mins until the top is golden and bubbling. Serve with a green salad.</li>
    </ol>
