    <h2>Description</h2>
    <p>Refried beans is a dish of cooked and mashed beans that is a traditional staple of Mexican and Tex-Mex cuisine, although each cuisine has a different approach when making the dish.</p>
    <h2>Ingredients</h2>
    <ul>
        <li>Olive Oil</li>
        <li>Chopped Onion</li>
        <li>Sea Salt</li>
        <li>2 Cloves of Garlic</li>
        <li>Chili Powder</li>
        <li>2 Cans of Pinto Beans</li>
        <li>Water</li>
        <li>Cilantro</li>
        <li>lime Juice</li>
    </ul>
    <h2>Steps</h2>
    <ol>
        <li>In a medium saucepan over medium heat, warm the olive oil until shimmering. Add the onions and salt. Cook, stirring occasionally, until the onions have softened and are turning translucent, about 5 to 8 minutes.</li>
        <li>Add the garlic, chili powder and cumin. Cook, stirring constantly, until fragrant, about 30 seconds. Pour in the drained beans and water. Stir, cover and cook for 5 minutes.</li>
        <li>Reduce the heat to low and remove the lid. Use a potato masher or the back of a fork to mash up about at least half of the beans, until you reach your desired consistency. Continue to cook the beans, uncovered, stirring often, for 3 more minutes.</li>
        <li>Remove the saucepan from the heat and stir in the cilantro and lime juice. Taste, and add more salt and lime juice if necessary. If the beans seem dry, add a very small splash of water and stir to combine. Cover until you’re ready to serve.</li>
    </ol>
